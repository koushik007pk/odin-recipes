    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that consists of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with various fillings and sauces. Traditionally, the filling includes a combination of ground meats, such as beef or pork, mixed with a rich tomato sauce (like ragù or bolognese), and layered with béchamel (a creamy white sauce) or ricotta cheese. Mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses are often added for extra flavor and a golden, bubbly top.</p>
    <p>Each layer is built up by stacking the pasta sheets, spreading a generous amount of sauce, and adding cheese or other ingredients like vegetables (such as spinach or mushrooms), depending on the recipe. After layering, the lasagna is baked in the oven until the top becomes golden and the cheese is melted and slightly crispy.</p>
    <p>Lasagna is loved for its hearty, comforting flavors, and its ability to feed a crowd. Variations exist, such as vegetarian versions, seafood lasagna, or lighter options made with different vegetables or gluten-free pasta. Its rich, filling nature makes it a popular choice for both family meals and special occasions.</p>
